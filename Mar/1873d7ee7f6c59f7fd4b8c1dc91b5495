The unbundling of the programme, which is among the recent major reforms by the Commission, is to meet current demands in university education in line with global development and best practices. This one-week course is designed to test key elements of the Development Communication curriculum with a sub-specialization on WEE. Twenty-eight journalists will be selected to participate in this pilot course between 29th March to 2nd April 2022 in Abuja. ACSPN and PAWED will fully fund this course including fees, accommodation, study materials, incidentals, and transportation for all selected participants. Women Journalists are enjoined to apply. Interested and qualified journalists are invited to submit a CV and publications on WEE produced in the past 5 years to opportunities4journalists@gmail.com Applications close on 24th of March 2022. The PAWED project is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and implemented by the development Research and Projects Centre (dRPC). PAWED – Building Salience for WEE
